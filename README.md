# JAva-Parallel-Editor
web service supporting multiprogramming, client server model
Created a web service which supports multi programming. Also used system calls which resulted in faster computation. Used SOAP request and response for faster communication between server and client. The compilation was considerably faster due to batch file processing and use of JDK trapping technique in the absence of command prompt. Supports concurrent programming and it is user friendly. Also legacy java users can adopt this editor in time.
